# SnakeCatcher
*The app that watches over your things*

## Premise
A lot of people leave their things unattended in libraries etc. to get something or go to the bathroom. Unless we are with a friend or someone we trust there is no knowing if things might get stolen. We want to solve that problem through our app.
